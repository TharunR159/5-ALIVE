Introduction: Space Mission Fuel Optimizer
Problem Overview
Fuel Optimization: The Core Challenge
Space missions demand meticulous fuel management due to the extreme constraints of space travel. Unlike terrestrial vehicles, spacecraft cannot refuel mid-journey, making every kilogram of fuel a critical resource. Excess fuel increases launch costs, affects payload capacity, and limits mission duration. Optimizing navigation ensures fuel is used only where necessary, enabling extended missions while maintaining efficiency.
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) in 3D Space
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known optimization problem that translates perfectly to space travel. A spacecraft must visit multiple waypoints while minimizing total travel distance, returning to its starting location. 
Minimizing travel distance is crucial for efficient fuel consumption in space missions, but navigating in ‚Äú3D space‚Äù adds complexity, requiring advanced computational methods for path optimization; the objective is to achieve a solution ‚Äúwithin 1%‚Äù of the theoretical minimum fuel cost to ensure near-optimal efficiency. 
Objectives:
The goal of this project is to develop an algorithm that:
1.Reads waypoint data from a text file containing coordinates.
2.Computes Euclidean distances between waypoints to determine travel costs.
3.Optimizes the travel path using a TSP-solving algorithm (e.g., dynamic programming or nearest neighbor heuristic).
4.Calculates total fuel consumption, ensuring it remains within 1% of the theoretical minimum.
5.Outputs results, containing the optimal sequence of waypoints and the total fuel cost.

TSP Solver Logic (High-Level Algorithm)

1)Parsing Input Data:
Reads waypoints.txt containing 3D coordinates (x, y, z).
Generates a distance matrix to compute travel costs between waypoints.

2)Distance Calculation (Fuel Consumption):
Fuel cost is determined using Euclidean distance, formulated as:
Each waypoint pair‚Äôs distance is stored in an N √ó N matrix.

3)Solving TSP (Path Optimization):
Since TSP is NP-hard, the implementation adapts based on waypoint count:
Brute-force search (Exact Solution for N ‚â§ 10)
Nearest Neighbor heuristic (Approximate Solution for N > 10)
2-Opt Optimization to refine heuristic results

4)Solution Optimization (2-Opt Algorithm):
Since heuristic methods may yield suboptimal paths, the implementation applies 2-opt refinement to eliminate unnecessary detours.
5)Output Generation & Validation:
The final path is stored in path.txt, ensuring: 
‚úÖ The path visits all waypoints exactly once. 
‚úÖ The path returns to the start.
‚úÖ Fuel cost is within 1% of the optimal value.

Programming Language & Libraries Used
Language: Python
Libraries: math ‚Äì For Euclidean distance calculations.

read_waypoints(filename): Reads waypoints.txt and extracts 3D coordinates.
Distance Calculation:
euclidean_3d(p1, p2): Computes Euclidean distance between waypoint pairs.
build_distance_matrix(waypoints): Generates an N √ó N distance matrix for TSP processing.

Execution Flow (main() function):

How to Run the Code
Ensure Python is installed (Python 3.x). Place waypoints.txt in the same directory as your script. Run the script using the command:
 ------>‚Äúpython main.py‚Äù
Dataset Handling: Parsing waypoints.txt

Overview
The waypoints.txt file contains 3D coordinates of waypoints in space, formatted as:
----> ‚Äúid x y z‚Äù
where:
Id is an integer identifier (1 ‚â§ id ‚â§ N).
x, y, z are floating-point coordinates (-1000 ‚â§ x, y, z ‚â§ 1000).
The script parses this file to extract coordinates and generate a distance matrix for TSP computations.

Parsing Logic
Read waypoints.txt line by line. 
Extract numeric values (converting id to an integer and x, y, z to floats). 
Store waypoints as tuples (id, x, y, z). 
Create an index-based list to maintain order for TSP processing.

Pseudocode:
‚ÄúOpen waypoints.txt
For each line:
Split by spaces
Convert values to appropriate data types (int for id, float for x, y, z)
Store as (id, x, y, z)
Return parsed waypoints‚Äù
Dataset Constraints & Validation:
Ensuring Correct Input Format:
Validates at least 5 waypoints (N ‚â• 5).
Ensures coordinates are within [-1000, 1000] range.



Output Format: path.txt
The output file, path.txt, contains the optimized waypoint visitation order and total fuel cost. The format is:
‚Äúid1 id2 id3 ... idN fuel_cost‚Äù

Breakdown of Output Structure
Waypoint IDs (id1, id2, ... idN)
Ordered list of waypoint identifiers (integer values).
Represents the exact order in which the spacecraft visits each waypoint.
The first and last IDs should be the same, ensuring the spacecraft returns to the starting location.
Total Fuel Cost (fuel_cost)
The sum of Euclidean distances between waypoints in the path.
Represented as a floating-point number rounded to two decimal places (e.g., 1250.75).
Ensures fuel consumption is within 1% of the minimum possible value.

Example Output Scenarios
üìå Example 1 (5 Waypoints)
‚Äú1 3 2 5 4 1 450.32‚Äù
The spacecraft starts at waypoint 1, visits waypoints 3 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 5 ‚Üí 4, and returns to 1.
üìå Example 2 (10 Waypoints)
‚Äú2 7 5 9 3 8 6 1 4 10 2 1250.75‚Äù
The spacecraft starts at waypoint 2, follows an optimized path through other waypoints, and returns to 2.

Test Case Results: Performance on the sample test case
Execution Summary
Your script (main.py) was executed in PowerShell, producing the following output:
‚Äú1 6 8 7 10 4 5 2 9 3 1 1886.77‚Äù
Optimal Path Computed: 1 ‚Üí 6 ‚Üí 8 ‚Üí 7 ‚Üí 10 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 5 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 9 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 1
Total Fuel Cost: 1886.77 units
This confirms that the TSP solver has successfully computed a valid route visiting each waypoint exactly once before returning to the starting point.

Performance Evaluation
1.Path Validity Check:The path includes all waypoints without duplicates.  The path returns to the starting waypoint (1), which meets problem constraints.
2.Fuel Cost Accuracy
The total fuel cost (1886.77) is computed using Euclidean distance.
To meet hackathon scoring criteria, fuel consumption must be within 1% of the optimal minimum.
Verification requires comparing this result with a benchmark optimal cost (e.g., from a brute-force or reference solution)
3.Execution Time Efficiency:
The solution must run within 10 seconds.
Given N ‚â§ 15 waypoints, heuristic methods (nearest neighbor + 2-opt optimization) should yield results much faster than brute-force methods.
Timing analysis should confirm whether the solution meets the required threshold.
